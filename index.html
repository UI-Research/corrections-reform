                <p>Unchecked growth in the federal prison population has led to widespread, bipartisan agreement that our corrections system is bloated, costly, and ineffective. By harnessing this momentum, policymakers can reform the federal prison system—stemming costs and reducing dangerous overcrowding, while improving public safety. The task is difficult, but a path forward has already been laid out.</p>

                <p>The Charles Colson Task Force on Federal Corrections, established by Congress, conducted a year-long fact-finding mission to examine challenges in the federal corrections system and develop policy solutions.</p>

                <p>We illustrate their findings here—the drivers of prison population growth, the policies that led us to this point, the task force’s recommendations, and the reasons reform is so urgent and necessary.</p>

                        <h2>Federal prison population up nearly 700 percent since 1980</h2>
                        <p>More than 2.2 million people are locked up in America’s prisons and jails. And the nation’s single largest jailer is the federal government.</p>
                        <p>Since 1980, the federal prison population has risen almost 700 percent, even though the crime rate has steadily fallen over the same period. The number of people in federal prisons peaked at nearly 220,000 in 2013, before falling to roughly 197,000 people in December 2015.</p>
                        <p>This growth comes with a price. From 1980 to 2016, the Bureau of Prisons’ budget shot up 685 percent to $7.5 billion. These funds mostly go toward the housing, infrastructure, and staff costs of incarceration, leaving little for rehabilitation and reentry efforts.</p>
                        <p>The collateral cost to families and communities is much harder to quantify. Children with incarcerated parents have exhibited more negative outcomes, such as poor academic performance, depression, and substance abuse. And whole communities can be disrupted and destabilized when residents—often men—cycle in and out of jail and return home unable to shake the stigma of a criminal record.</p>
                        <p>What’s more, a growing body of evidence suggests that mass incarceration may actually undermine public safety, particularly if it comes at the expense of other funding priorities.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="subsection">
                        <h2>What’s driving growth?</h2>
                        <p>Today’s prison population looks very different than it did decades ago. More people are being sent to federal prison and for longer periods of time, largely due to policy changes beginning in the 1980s.</p>
                        <p>Between 1985 and 2014, the probability of receiving a prison sentence as opposed to probation for a federal crime increased dramatically from 50 to 90 percent. The number of convictions in US courts nearly doubled from 40,924 to 76,835, and average time served for drug and weapon crimes each went up from about two years to almost five.</p>
                        <p>Of those changes, the biggest driver of growth is drug offenses, specifically longer sentences for these crimes. 
</p>
                    </div>
                    <!--same "slide in text but different graph data-->
                    <div class="subsection">
                        <p>While the number of people entering federal prison for drug crimes has stayed roughly the same for over a decade the population continued to grow because sentences are longer than they used to be. With sentences requiring years, if not decades, of incarceration, the number of people behind bars stacked up.</p>
                        <p>The same is true for weapon and sex offenses. People convicted of immigration offenses, however, tend to serve less time. Though the number of people sentenced to federal prison for drug crimes and for immigration crimes is roughly the same, substantially more people are in federal prison for drug crimes than for immigration offenses.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="subsection">
                        <h2>Mandatory minimums are behind longer sentences</h2>
                        <p>Mandatory minimums dictate penalties for certain drug crimes and other offenses, but many argue that they can be too inflexible and severe, sending people to prison for years for less serious offenses or technicalities. Minimum penalties for drug offenses, for example, are based solely on the quantity of the drug and not whether the person charged used violence or played a big role in drug trafficking organizations.</p>
                        <p>Of the more than 90,000 people in federal prison for drug offenses at the end of FY2014, 80 percent were convicted of an offense that carried a mandatory minimum penalty. About a quarter received <span class="notapplied">relief from mandatory minimums at sentencing</span>.</p>

                    </div>
                    <!--single slide in word doc-->
                    <div class="subsection">
                        <p>For the rest, their average expected time served is <span class="applied">over 10 years</span>, compared with <span class="notapplicable">less than six years</span> for those convicted of a drug offense not subject to a mandatory minimum.</p>
                        <p>Mandatory minimums for weapons and sex offenses can also yield long prison terms.</p>
                        <p>Other policy changes also contributed to longer sentences for those in federal prison. The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 led to strict federal sentencing guidelines, did away with parole, and reduced the amount that could be earned off a sentence for good conduct.</p>

                        <h2>Black and Hispanic people hit hardest by mandatory minimums</h2>
                        <p>Since 1994, over 75 percent of federal prison growth has come from an increase in black and Hispanic people serving time. This also means that the collateral costs of incarceration fall disproportionately on communities of color.</p>
                        <p>People of color, especially black men, are hit particularly hard by certain mandatory minimums. For example, crimes involving crack cocaine are punished more harshly than those involving powder cocaine, a different form of the same drug. And black people were much more likely to be convicted of crimes involving crack.</p>
                        <p>Congress lessened this disparity with the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, substantially reducing the number of federal prosecutions for crack offenses, but the effects of the old law are still seen in the prison population. Although only 2,439 people were sentenced in 2014 for crack cocaine offenses, 22,714 people were in prison for those crimes at the end of the fiscal year. Of that group, 63 percent were sentenced prior to the Act and almost 90 percent were black.</p>
                    </div>


                    <div class="subsection">
                        <h2>Many in prison for drug offenses have minimal criminal histories</h2>
                        <p>Of the more than 90,000 people serving time for drug crimes in federal prison in 2014, almost half (45 percent) had little to no criminal history, which means they’re less likely to commit another crime.</p>
                        <p>More than a quarter of those in federal prison for drug offenses had no prior convictions. Moreover, almost 80 percent had no serious history of violence before their current offense.</p>
                        <p>People with weapon and immigration convictions have more extensive criminal and violent histories than those charged with drug offenses.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="subsection">
                        <h2>Most people convicted of drug offenses are in lower-security prisons </h2>
                        <p>To deal with the large number of people entering federal prisons, the Bureau of Prisons has added substantially more beds, particularly in minimum- and low-security facilities, where 59 percent of the BOP population is housed. Tellingly, of the more than 95,000 people in federal prison for drugs, 64,780 are in minimum or low security facilities.</p>
                        <p>But this growth has also taken resources away from where they are needed most. Overcrowding is worst in medium- and high-security facilities, which tend to house those who pose the greatest security risk. Bureau of Prisons facilities were 20 percent over capacity at the end of 2015; high-security prisons were 45 percent over capacity.</p>
                        <p>Overcrowding can escalate tension behind bars, creating conditions that threaten the safety of corrections officers and those they oversee. It also makes it harder for prisons to provide reentry programs, treatment, and health services. Every staff member is trained to handle security, so everyone from teachers to psychologists can be diverted to fill security posts when the prison is short-staffed. This is especially troubling given that higher risk individuals may have the greatest needs for intensive programming.</p>

                <h2>A roadmap for reform</h2>
                <p>In creating a path forward for reforming the federal corrections system, the Task Force was guided by the following evidence-based principles, each informed by the overarching goal of improving public safety:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sentencing decisions and correctional interventions should be individualized.</li>
                        <li>Correctional policy should improve public safety.</li>
                        <li>Incarceration, with its attendant costs to both those in prison and taxpayers, should be employed judiciously.</li>
                        <li>Data and research should guide practice.</li>
                        <li>Reforms should both address prison growth and improve public safety outcomes.</li>

                        <h2>Reform could reduce the federal prison population by 60,000 people and save $5 billion</h2>
                        <p>A year of interviews, data analysis, and research laid the foundation for a path to reform. Based on this evidence and guided by the principles above, the Task Force developed the following recommendations, which are described in greater detail in their report:
                            <ol>
                                <li>At sentencing, the federal system should reserve prison beds for those convicted of the most serious federal crimes.</li>
                                <li>In prison, the federal Bureau of Prisons should promote a culture of safety and rehabilitation and ensure that programming is allocated in accordance with individual risk and needs.</li>
                                <li>Throughout the prison term, correctional policies should incentivize participation in risk-reduction programming.</li>
                                <li>Prior to and following release, the federal correctional system should ensure successful reintegration by using evidence-based practices in supervision and support.</li>
                                <li>The federal criminal justice system should enhance performance and accountability through better coordination across agencies and increased transparency.</li>
                                <li>Congress should reinvest savings to support the expansion of necessary programs, supervision, and treatment.</li>

                <p>Taken as a whole, these recommendations are estimated to reduce the federal prison population by more than 60,000 people by FY2024, compared with current population forecasts. The decrease would come largely from shortening most drug-related prison sentences. With this reduction, the federal government could save over $5 billion. Those savings could be reinvested into programs and services to help those in prison return home, avoid reoffending, and rebuild their lives.
