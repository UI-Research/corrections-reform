                        <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Federal prison population has grown nearly 700 percent since 1980</h4>
                        <p>More than 2.2 million people are locked up in America’s prisons and jails, and the nation’s largest jailer is the federal government.</p>
                        <p>Since 1980, the federal prison population has risen almost 700 percent despite a steady decrease in the national crime rate over the same period. The number of people in federal prisons peaked at nearly 220,000 in 2013 before falling to roughly 196,000 people by early 2016.</p>
                        <p>This growth comes with a price. From 1980 to 2016, the Bureau of Prisons’ budget shot up 685 percent to $7.5 billion. These funds mostly go toward the housing, infrastructure, and staff costs of incarceration, leaving little for rehabilitation and reentry efforts.</p>
                        <p>The collateral cost to families and communities is much harder to quantify. Children with incarcerated parents exhibit more negative outcomes, such as poor academic performance, depression, substance abuse, and physical aggression, than their peers. Whole communities can be disrupted and destabilized when residents—often men—cycle in and out of jail and return home unable to shake the stigma of a criminal record.</p>
                        <p>What’s more, a growing body of evidence suggests that mass incarceration may actually undermine public safety, particularly if it comes at the expense of other funding priorities.</p>

                    <div class="subsection">
                        <h4 class="subsectiontitle">What’s driving growth?</h4>
                        <p>The prison population looks very different today than it did decades ago. More people are sent to federal prison and for longer periods of time, largely due to policy changes beginning in the 1980s.</p>
                        <p>Between 1985 and 2014, the probability of receiving a prison sentence as opposed to probation for a federal crime increased dramatically from 50 percent to 90 percent. The number of convictions in US courts nearly doubled, from 40,924 to 76,835, and average time served for drug and weapon crimes each went up from about two years to almost five. Many of these front end changes occurred soon after the passage of key legislation in the 1980s, though the prison population continued to grow for decades thereafter.</p>
                        <p>Of those changes, the biggest driver of growth is drug offenses, specifically longer sentences for these crimes.</p>

                        <p>Though the number of people entering federal prison for drug crimes has stayed roughly the same for over a decade, the population continued to grow because sentences are longer than they used to be. With sentences requiring years, if not decades, of incarceration, the number of people behind bars stacked up. The same is true for weapon and sex offenses.</p>
                        <p>People convicted of immigration offenses, however, tend to serve less time, so large increases in admissions for immigration offenses has not led to the same multiplicative growth. Though the number admitted to federal prison for drug crimes and for immigration crimes is roughly the same, substantially more people are in federal prison for drug crimes than for immigration offenses—but immigration is still the third most prevalent offense type in the federal prison population because so many people are admitted each year.</p>

                        <p>Mandatory minimum sentences dictate penalties for certain drug crimes and other offenses, but many argue that they are too inflexible and severe, sending people to prison for years for minor offenses or technicalities. Minimum penalties for drug offenses are based solely on the quantity of the drug and not whether the person charged used violence or played a big role in drug trafficking organizations.</p>
                        <p>Of the more than 90,000 people in federal prison for drug offenses at the end of FY2014, 59 percent were <span class="yellow">sentenced to a mandatory minimum penalty</span>. Another 19 percent had been convicted of an offense subject to a mandatory minimum but were <span class="blue">granted relief at sentencing</span>.</p>

                        <p class="large">To safely reduce the federal prison population, we need to take a closer look at who is in the system and where they’re housed.</p>
                        <hr>

                        <h4 class="subsectiontitle">A geographic look at the federal prison system</h4>
                        <p>The federal prison system is vast, spanning 122 facilities across the country. Add to that 94 federal judicial districts where prosecution, sentencing, and postrelease supervision occur.</p>
                        <p>Federal prosecutors have wide latitude in choosing the cases they prosecute and the charges they file. So the number and makeup of people in federal prison from any district may reflect the types of crimes that occur in that district and local prosecutorial priorities. For example, while most drug and immigration cases are concentrated along the US–Mexico border (and to a lesser extent, southern Florida), weapon and sex offenses follow less of a clear geographic trend.</p>
                        <p>The Bureau of Prisons attempts to assign people to prisons within 500 miles of their home, but more than a quarter are housed farther away. Family support is critical for helping people return home after prison, but it can be difficult to stay connected over long distances. Our map shows the distance between the judicial districts where people were sentenced (often, but not always, near their homes) and the prisons to which they were assigned.</p>

                    </div>

                    <div class="subsection">
                        <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Black and Hispanic people hit hardest by prison growth</h4>
                        <p>Since 1994, over 75 percent of growth in the federal prison population has come from <span class="blue">black</span> and <span class="lightgrey">Hispanic</span> people. This also means that the collateral costs of incarceration fall disproportionately on communities of color.</p>
                        <p>People of color, especially black men, are hit particularly hard by certain mandatory minimums. Crimes involving crack cocaine are punished more harshly than those involving powder cocaine, and black people are much more likely to be convicted of crimes involving crack.</p>
                        <p>Congress lessened this disparity with the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of federal prosecutions for crack offenses, but the effects of the old law are still seen in the prison population. Although only 2,439 people were sentenced in 2014 for crack cocaine offenses, about 23,000 people were in prison for crack offenses at the end of the fiscal year. Of that group, 63 percent had been sentenced prior to the Fair Sentencing Act and almost 90 percent were black.</p>

                        <p>Of the more than 90,000 people serving time for drug crimes in federal prison in 2014, almost half (45 percent) had little to no previous criminal history, which also means they’re less likely to commit another crime. More than a quarter had no prior convictions, and almost 80 percent had no serious history of violence before their current offense.</p>
                        <p>People with weapon and immigration convictions have more extensive criminal and violent histories than those charged with drug offenses.</p>

                        <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Most people convicted of drug offenses are in lower-security prisons </h4>
                        <p>To deal with the large number of people entering federal prisons, the Bureau of Prisons has added substantially more beds across the system, including in minimum- and low-security facilities, where 59 percent of the population is housed. Of the more than 95,000 people in federal prison for drug offenses, 64,780 are in these facilities.</p>
                        <p>But this growth has also diverted resources from where they are needed most. Overcrowding is worst in medium- and high-security facilities. Bureau of Prisons facilities were 20 percent over capacity at the end of 2015; high-security prisons were 45 percent over capacity.</p>
                        <p>Overcrowding can escalate tensions behind bars, creating conditions that threaten the safety of corrections officers and the prison population. It also makes it harder for prisons to provide reentry programs, treatment, and health services. This is especially troubling given that higher-risk individuals may have the greatest needs for intensive programming. Moreover, every staff member is given security training, so everyone from teachers to psychologists can be reassigned to security posts when the prison is short-staffed, further cutting into prisons’ ability to provide services and programming.</p>

                            <p class="large">In creating a path forward for reforming the federal corrections system, the Task Force was guided by the following evidence-based principles, each informed by the overarching goal of improving public safety:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Sentencing decisions and correctional interventions should be individualized.</li>
                                    <li>Correctional policy should improve public safety.</li>
                                    <li>Incarceration, with its attendant costs to both those in prison and taxpayers, should be employed judiciously.</li>
                                    <li>Data and research should guide practice.</li>
                                    <li>Reforms should both address prison growth and improve public safety outcomes.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>

                            <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Absent more reforms, the federal prison population is unlikely to decline further</h4>
                            <p>Congress, the judiciary, and the Obama administration have taken steps to improve the federal corrections system, but the work has just begun. Though these reforms will provide some relief, they’re not enough to end severe overcrowding.</p>

                            <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Reform could cut the federal prison population by 60,000 and save $5 billion by 2024</h4>
                            <p>A year of interviews, data analysis, and research laid the foundation for a path to reform. Based on this evidence and guided by the principles above, the Task Force developed the following recommendations, described in greater detail in their report:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>At sentencing, the federal system should reserve prison beds for those convicted of the most serious federal crimes.</li>
                                    <li>In prison, the federal Bureau of Prisons should promote a culture of safety and rehabilitation and ensure that programming is allocated in accordance with individual risk and needs.</li>
                                    <li>Throughout the prison term, correctional policies should incentivize participation in risk-reduction programming.</li>
                                    <li>Prior to and following release, the federal correctional system should ensure successful reintegration by using evidence-based practices in supervision and support.</li>
                                    <li>The federal criminal justice system should enhance performance and accountability through better coordination across agencies and increased transparency.</li>
                                    <li>Congress should reinvest savings to support the expansion of necessary programs, supervision, and treatment.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>
                            <p>Together, these recommendations could reduce the expected federal prison population in FY2024 by more than 60,000. The decrease, largely a result of shortening most drug-related sentences, could save the federal government over $5 billion. Those savings could be reinvested into programs and services that help those in prison return home, avoid reoffending, and rebuild their lives.</p>
